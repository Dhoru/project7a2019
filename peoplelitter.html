      <h2>Why Do People Litter?</h2>

      <p><em>Litter on a street (above)</em></p>
      <p>Littering continues to be a big environmental problem in cities.</p>
      <p>According to the California State University, the farther away you are from a trash can or a recycling container, the more likely you are to litter. People are also more likely to litter if they are in a place that's already highly littered, than a place that is clean.</p>
      <p>The presence of existing litter was strongly predictive of littering behavior. </p>
      <p>However, in Male', people are ignorant about littering and there are not enough garbage cans on the streets. Littering is a common practice because the streets are littered.</p>
      <p>So, maybe if cities put trash or recycling containers in public spaces, maybe people start doing the right thing again.</p>
      <p>Also, if people stop littering entirely, other people will also not litter and the place will remain clean. </p>
